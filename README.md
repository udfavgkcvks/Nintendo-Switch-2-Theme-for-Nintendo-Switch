# Nintendo-Switch-2-Theme-for-Nintendo-Switch
This theme for the Nintendo Switch's main menu was created for firmware 19. **Please note that installation on firmware version 20 is not advised.**

It aims to give your Nintendo Switch the appearance and atmosphere of a potential Nintendo Switch 2. **This theme is exclusively for use with Emunand.** It removes the icons for the eShop, NSO, and News, and the Album icon's color has been altered to gray for an improved visual style.
