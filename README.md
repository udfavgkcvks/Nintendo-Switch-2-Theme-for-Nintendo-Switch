# Nintendo-Switch-2-Theme-for-Nintendo-Switch
This is the main menu theme for the Nintendo Switch, which was developed for firmware version 19.

The theme is an attempt to bring the look and feel of Nintendo Switch 2 to the Nintendo Switch. The theme is intended **for Emunand only**. It has removed the eShop, NSO, and News icons. And the color of the album icon was changed to gray for better visual aesthetics.
