# Switch 2 Switch Theme
This theme for the Nintendo Switch's main menu was created for firmware 19. **Please note that installation on firmware version 20 is not advised.**

It aims to give your Nintendo Switch the appearance and atmosphere of a potential Nintendo Switch 2. **This theme is exclusively for use with Emunand.** It removes the icons for the eShop, NSO, and News, and the Album icon's color has been altered to gray for an improved visual style.

The basis for this theme was [Banned](https://themezer.net/layouts/homemenu/Banned-8) Layout by Les, which was later modified using Gemini 2.5 Pro. Key visual changes implemented for this purpose include removing the background from the bottom icons and rounding the game icons to match the expected look of the Nintendo Switch 2 menu interface. 

To remove the bottom line, I used Common Layout with [Flow Layout](https://themezer.net/layouts/homemenu/Flow-Layout-5).

All design were created in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/i0rL3mLoNNcL9llyaiFOdc/Switch-2-Switch-Theme?node-id=0-1&t=YALWsuX1J6M1Bcow-1). So you can make a duplicate of this and modify it as you want.

The theme was created in light and dark versions. Don't forget to switch between system themes so that the icons don't blend into the background.
